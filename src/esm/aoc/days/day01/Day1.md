# Problem description

* [Part 1](./Part1.md)
* [Part 2](./Part2.md)

# Data Model

Each input line is a single number.

# Solution - Part 1

As in previous years, day 1 has eased us in! This puzzle can be brute-forced - 
try every combination of numbers until you find a pair which sum to 2020.

# Solution - Part 2

As above, the introduction of a third comparison doesn't make the problem too complex for a
brute force approach - now we need three loops not two.
