# Advent of Code 2020

[Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/) coming soon!

Some years I have more time than others, but I usually like to include an explanation of the code / algorithms as well as the code itself.
This year I'm about to start using Java professionally again, so using this as a way to ease myself back into it.
